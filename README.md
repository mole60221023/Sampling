# Sampling
The program corresponding to the Sampling experiment for quantitative chemical analysis

This program was built using Google Colab.

See the corresponding guided learning excersise for use in the classroom.

---
The block of code for parts 1, 2, and 5 will allow for changing the sample size and percent of each particle in the sample.  Sampling is done with replacement.
The blocks of code (intended for Part 3 of the guided learning handout) will set a random percent of particles between 10 and 90 %.  Once Block 1 is run do not run it again or it will change the random percent.  Block 2 will allow for the sampling with a student chosen sample size.  Block 3 will print the correct answer of the percent of each type of particle.
The block of code for part 4 will allow students to see the variation in sampling over an input number of times to sample with replacement.
The block of code for part 6 will allow students to calculate the relative standard deviation of particle percents for a given sample size and number of times sampled with replacement.
